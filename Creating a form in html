Creating a form in html

Start by enclosing in the <form> tag
add an action to be performed eg. entering a url
select user input via the type attribute eg. text, email and name the action
a placeholder givers user a clue about the input needed
the required attribute prevents the form being submitted with missing information. Just ensure space around required word and other attributes
Button element is used to create a clickable button eg. <button>Click Here</button>
-without attributes, clicking form button will submit to action location
input field and button appear on same line as they are in-line elements which don't appear on new lines
add type attribute to button for clarity

<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

Radio button allows you to select one option from many eg. <input type="radio"> Indoor
label tag allows you to select the radio button by clicking the word next to the button eg.  <label><input type="radio"> Indoor</label>
the id attribute helps identify the html element
for selection of one button to deselect the other, give butons the same name attribute
form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. For convenience, set the button's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.
eg.  <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" > Indoor</label>
